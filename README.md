# Code Refactor Starter Code

This project was my motivation for fixing and cleaning the code of an exisiting project. My motivation was to be able to understand, clean and complete this project in order to attain the best possible outcome from my grade and my experience. I fixed and cleaned this project so I can get exposed to prior code, and be able to make it the best I could. I hope you guys can enjoy looking at the code and enjoy the functionality of the site!
